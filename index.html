    <h1>Legendary Japanese Tuner Cars</h1>
    <br>
    <p>There are a lot of japanese cars that were overengineered to handle more horsepower and to be track monsters, they just need
         help unlocking that potential.</p>

    <p>I've compiled a list of my personal favorites.</p>
        <br>
    <h2>Honda Civic</h2>

    <p>The Honda Civic is one of the best Japanese cars, with its presence and popularity going across continents and stretching back decades, the Civic has earned its place among the cars that impacted automotive culture.
</p>
    <p>In its stock form, the Honda Civic is already a capable vehicle, a good-looking sub-compact with several body styles and powerplants to choose from, its excellent engineering and build quality have ensured that each new iteration of the Civic has been a hit.</p>
    <p>It for these very reasons why the Civic has been a popular car to modify, with its owners doing extensive builds that boost its performance or improve its looks. In this article, we look at the Civic from the perspective of a modder- This is why the Honda Civic is a favorite among tuners.
    </p>
    <p>From the entry-level 1.3L up to the 2.0L turbocharged engine of the high spec versions, the Honda Civic has had various engine configurations. Tuners though would normally swap their stock engine and drop in either a B or K series that would provide a massive HP upgrade.</p>
    <p>From OEM, aftermarket, or fabricated components, the number of performance parts available for Honda Civics is astonishing. This is because of the inherent capacity and number of ways to modify the engine that make it easy to tune and squeeze HP, which in some extreme mods have resulted in 1,800HP Civic.</p>
    <p>A popular reason why Civics are popular is because of its VTEC engine. VTEC is a valve timing tech of Honda that gives better combustion/fuel atomization that improves total airflow providing higher top-end power.</p>
